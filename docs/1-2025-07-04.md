# Commit #1 - 2025-07-04: Docker Configuration Implementation

## Overview
This commit implements comprehensive Docker configuration for the AI Avatar project, enabling containerized deployment with all necessary dependencies and environment variables.

## Changes Made

### Docker Support and Environment Management
- Added full Docker support for the project, enabling easy deployment and development with both local and external (cloud) databases.
- Created Dockerfile for building and running the Node.js/TypeScript application in a containerized environment.
- Added .dockerignore to optimize Docker build context and exclude unnecessary files.
- Added docker-compose.yml for default local development (Node.js app + MongoDB + Redis).
- Added docker-compose.local.yml for explicit local database development.
- Added docker-compose.external.yml for production/external database scenarios (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, Redis Cloud).
- Ensured persistent Docker volumes for MongoDB and Redis to keep data between restarts and rebuilds.

### Documentation and Configuration
- Created DOCKER.md with detailed instructions for running, configuring, and troubleshooting the application in Docker (local and production).
- Created INSTALL.md with a step-by-step installation and setup guide for new users.
- Updated .env.example to clearly show configuration for both local and external database usage.
- Updated README.md to include Docker usage and environment setup instructions.

### Project Structure and Best Practices
- Moved instruction.md to docs/instruction.md to keep project documentation organized.
- Ensured all code, comments, and documentation in code are in English (as per project rules).
- All project and deployment documentation is in English, user-facing instructions in Polish.
- No sensitive data or real API keys are included in any committed files.

### Environment and Flexibility
- Environment variables are now fully configurable for all deployment scenarios (local, cloud, production).
- Switching between local and external databases is possible by changing the Docker Compose file and environment variables, without code changes.

### Detailed File Changes
- Dockerfile – Added for building and running the app in Docker.
- .dockerignore – Added to exclude unnecessary files from Docker context.
- docker-compose.yml – Default local development stack (Node.js, MongoDB, Redis).
- docker-compose.local.yml – Explicit local DB stack.
- docker-compose.external.yml – For external/production DBs.
- DOCKER.md – Docker usage, troubleshooting, and best practices.
- INSTALL.md – Quick start and installation guide.
- .env.example – Updated for both local and external DB scenarios.
- README.md – Updated with Docker and environment setup.
- docs/instruction.md – Moved and used as the main project rules reference.

### Notes
- All changes follow the project rules from docs/instruction.md.
- This commit enables seamless development and deployment with Docker, both for local and production environments.
- No breaking changes for existing code or API.
